      Return Authorization number. If you have questions, please call our service department for assistance.

    <li>Save the packing material and its original carton(s)! We take great care to package your purchase properly, so
      please reuse them when shipping your machine back to us.

      missing manuals, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to charge a 20% restocking fee if the above conditions are not met.

  <p>Once we receive your return package it will be inspected and a refund will be
    issued to your card less the original outbound freight cost if your order
    included free shipping. We will notify you via email after your items are received and after we have credited your
    card. </p>

  <p>Refunds are issued as a credit to the original credit card used in the purchase.
    If we cannot refund the original credit card used for purchase, such as cancelled
    credit cards or gift recipients, we will issue store credit (we do
    not issue refunds via company check). Please allow up to 14 days to receive your refund. </p>
